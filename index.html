        >“Nobody hears the poor. It is the rich who are being heard.”—a
        discussion group of poor men and women, Egypt <br>“Poverty is humiliation,
        the sense of being dependent and of being forced to accept rudeness,
        insults, and indifference when we seek help.”—a poor woman, Latvia <br> “When
        the poor and rich compete for services, the rich will always get
        priority.”—a discussion group of poor men and women, Kenya

    <h2>What is our mission ?</h2>
    <p>
      so our mission is to get to know the problem of the people and then try
      every possible way to solve it.And i think
      <strong>it is not possible without your support</strong>
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>How will we achieve it?</h2>
    <p>
      So here is a plan which i have thought will work best. So I will help
      everyone I see in need. And I will also provide a helpline number so that
      anyone can call and share his/her problem and then I will act on that
      accordingly. In the begining i will make it public so that not only me but
      everyone can help because everyone should help
